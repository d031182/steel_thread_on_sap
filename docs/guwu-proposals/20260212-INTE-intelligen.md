**Proposal ID**: 20260212-INTE-intelligen  
**Date**: 2026-02-12  
**Capability**: IntelligenceEngine  
**Priority**: P1  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Confidence**: 0.12

## Problem Statement

Improve flaky test detection algorithm

## Proposed Solution

Enhance IntelligenceEngine to handle: Improve flaky test detection algorithm

## Implementation Steps

1. Analyze current IntelligenceEngine implementation
2. Design enhancement architecture
3. Implement core functionality
4. Write unit tests (Gu Wu standards)
5. Integrate with existing system
6. Validate with real test cases
7. Update documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
