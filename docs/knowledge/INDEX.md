## 🎉 Recent Updates

### 2026-02-07 (12:40 PM)
**Log Integration Proposal Created** ⭐ NEW:
- ✅ [[Log Integration Proposal]] - Comprehensive plan to integrate application logs into quality ecosystem
  - **Problem**: Rich log data (SQLite at logs/app_logs.db) isolated from Feng Shui/Gu Wu/Shi Fu
  - **Opportunity**: Runtime intelligence (errors, warnings, performance) can enhance all quality tools
  - **Approach**: Create unified Log Intelligence Layer feeding into existing tools
  - **Architecture**: Three layers (Intelligence Layer → Tool Adapters → Enhanced Tools)
  - **Feng Shui Integration**: Runtime DI violations, performance hotspots, module error rates
  - **Gu Wu Integration**: Flaky test root cause, coverage gaps from errors, performance regression
  - **Shi Fu Integration**: Code→Test→Runtime triangle pattern, deployment impact, learning from production
  - **Roadmap**: 5 phases, 28-40 hours (3-4 weeks), incremental adoption
  - **Success Metrics**: 80% detection rate, 90% correlation accuracy, <1hr response time
  - **Risk Mitigation**: Performance (indexed queries, caching), data quality (validation), false positives (confidence scoring)
  - **Philosophy**: "Logs are the voice of runtime - quality tools should listen"
  - **Status**: 🟡 Awaiting user approval to proceed with Phase 1
  - **Questions**: Priority vs security fixes? All 3 tools or incremental? Timeline fit? Specific patterns first?

### 2026-02-05 (2:48 AM)
**Feng Shui vs Gu Wu Architecture Clarification**:
- ✅ [[Feng Shui vs Gu Wu Separation]] - Complete rationale for keeping frameworks separate
  - **User Wisdom**: "Should not move feng shui into gu wu and dilute the feng shui framework"
  - **Feng Shui** (tools/fengshui/): Code organization, file structure, DI compliance, 22-check gate
  - **Gu Wu** (tests/guwu/): Test optimization, coverage gaps, auto-fix, AI capabilities
  - **Key Distinction**: Feng Shui = WHERE things are. Gu Wu = HOW tests execute.
  - **Why Separate**: Different concerns, tools, workflows, scopes, evolution paths
  - **Complementary**: Feng Shui finds organizational issues → Work packages. Gu Wu finds test gaps → Test templates.
  - **Reusability**: Copy independently (Feng Shui 20min, Gu Wu 15min, Both 35min)
  - **Anti-Patterns**: Don't merge, don't move Feng Shui to tests/, don't move Gu Wu to core/
  - **Philosophy**: Two frameworks, one goal - production-ready quality
  - Stored in MCP memory for all future sessions
