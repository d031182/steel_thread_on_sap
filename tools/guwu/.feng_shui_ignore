# Feng Shui Exclusion for Gu Wu Testing Framework
#
# Gu Wu (顾武) is a self-contained, autonomous testing framework.
# Feng Shui (风水) code quality system must not interfere with Gu Wu's operation.
#
# WHY: 
# - Gu Wu is self-optimizing and learns from its own patterns
# - Feng Shui modifications could disrupt Gu Wu's learning algorithms
# - Each system has its own quality standards and purposes
#
# RULE: Feng Shui scripts must exclude the entire tests/guwu/ directory

# Exclude all files in this directory
